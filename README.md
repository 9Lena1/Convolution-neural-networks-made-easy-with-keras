# Convolution neural networks made easy with keras
By Wang Ming Rui

## Introduction
Image recognition is the task of taking an image and classifying it. For us humans, this is one of the first skills we learn from the moment we are born and is one that comes naturally and effortlessly. By the time we reach adulthood we are able to immediately recognize patterns and put labels onto objects we see. These skills to quickly identify images, generalized from prior knowledge, are ones that we do not share with our machines.

When a computer sees an image, it will see an array of pixel values, each between a range of 0 to 255. These values while meaningless to us are the only input available to a machine. No one knows how exactly we living beings processes images but scientists today uses a technique called deep learning to simulate the effects of image recognition, albeit at a basic level when compared to what humans are capable of.

In this guide we aim to give readers a general understanding of what a convolution neural network (CNN) is and how to easily make one using the [keras library](#https://keras.io/).

## Before we get started
Though not necessary, some recommended prerequisites to this guide are:
- [python programming skills](#https://learnpythonthehardway.org/)
- [basic understanding of machine learning concepts and intuition](#https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)

The goal of this article is to allow anyone with coding abilities to create their own deep learning model for image identification.

Coming soon, I'm still tuning the model to get a right balance of scale and speed
