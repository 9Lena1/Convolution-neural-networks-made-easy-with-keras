## Introduction
Image recognition is the task of taking an image and correctly identifying it's descriptor. For humans, this is one of the first skills we learn from the moment we are born and is one that comes naturally and effortlessly. By the time we reach adulthood we are able to immediately recognize patterns and put labels onto objects. These skills to quickly identify images, generalized from prior knowledge are ones that we do not share with our machines.

When a computer sees an image, it will see an array of pixel values, each between a range of 0 to 255. These values while meaningless to us are the only input available to a machine.

## Before we get started
Some recommended prerequisites to this guide are:
- basic understanding of machine learning concepts and intuition
- python programming skills
