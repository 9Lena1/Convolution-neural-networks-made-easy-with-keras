## Introduction
Image recognition is the task of taking an image and classifying it. For us humans, this is one of the first skills we learn from the moment we are born and is one that comes naturally and effortlessly. By the time we reach adulthood we are able to immediately recognize patterns and put labels onto objects we see. These skills to quickly identify images, generalized from prior knowledge, are ones that we do not share with our machines.

When a computer sees an image, it will see an array of pixel values, each between a range of 0 to 255. These values while meaningless to us are the only input available to a machine. No one knows how exactly we living beings processes images but scientists today uses a technique called deep learning to simulate the effects of image recognition, albeit at a much more basic level than what humans are capable of.
